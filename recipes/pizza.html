                <li>1 (14 ounce) can of pizza sauce</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Cheese</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>8 ounces low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella, very thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1/4th a cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.</li>
                <li>Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.</li>
                <li>Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)</li>
                <li>Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.</li>
            </ol>
